 B1       MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES
 B1.1     During the term of this agreement the employer shall continue to act as a good employer in all
          dealings with the employee. This includes providing;
          (a)   Good and safe working conditions; and
          (b)   An equal employment opportunities programme; and
          (c)   The impartial selection of suitably qualified persons for appointment; and
          (d)   Opportunities for the enhancement of the abilities of individual employees; and
          (e)   Recognition of the aims and aspirations and employment requirements and the cultural
                differences, of ethnic or minority groups; and
          (f)   Recognition of the employment requirements of women; and
          (g)   Recognition of the employment requirements of persons with disabilities.
 B1.2     The employee shall during the continuance of the employment:
          (a) Diligently and faithfully serve the employer and endeavour to promote and protect the interests
               of the University, and to act in a collegial manner; and
          (b) Carry out and comply with all the employer’s reasonable and lawful directions; and
          (c) Diligently perform the duties as agreed between the employer and the employee, and fulfil
               obligations to students; and
          (d) Comply with all the University’s statutes, guidelines and policies, which may be amended by the

 B2.2     University employees may belong to Unisaver in accordance with the provisions of that scheme.
 B2.3     The University is an exempt employer and, although the employee can choose to join Kiwisaver, the

          Kiwisaver, when they are appointed to the University, they will need to inform the payroll office so
          that the requisite deductions can be made.
 B2.4     Where the employee is a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund the University will

 SECTION C:        HOURS OF WORK
 C1       HOURS OF WORK
 C1.1     37.5 hours shall constitute an ordinary full time week’s work to be worked between 7 am and 9 pm
          Monday to Friday and 8 am and 5 pm Saturday, normally on five consecutive 7.5 hour days except for
          employees in the Library rostered for shift duties whose ordinary hours of work shall be 7.5 hours per
          day and 37.5 hours per week to be worked on any five days of the week.
 C1.2     By mutual agreement of the employer and the employee the hours may be varied within a 37.5 hour
          work week and worked on not more than five days.
 C1.3     As far as possible the hours of work shall be continuous except for an unpaid meal break of not more
          than one hour or less than 30 minutes each day.
 C1.4     In addition, employees shall be granted a rest period of 10 minutes in each period of four hours
          worked. Normally that rest period shall be allowed after not less than two hours work. All employees
          are to receive free tea, coffee, milk and sugar for breaks.
 C1.5     All employees shall have regular hours, however these may be varied by mutual agreement following
          discussion between the employer and any employee(s) directly affected by the variation. Any such
          variation shall be recorded in writing.
 C1.6     Flexitime may operate by mutual agreement between the employer and the individual employee
          concerned, within the ordinary hours of work specified within this agreement.
 C1.7     In special circumstances an employee may be required temporarily to vary starting and/or finishing
          times.
 C1.8     Staff may be granted time off on the basis of one hour for each hour worked over and above their
          contracted hours at the discretion of the employer.
 C2       MINIMUM BREAK BETWEEN FULL SHIFTS
 C2.1     A break of at least nine continuous hours must be provided wherever possible between any two shifts
          which shall take account of reasonable travel time.
 C2.2     A full shift means a continuous period of work of 7.5 or more hours.
          This requirement to provide a break wherever possible applies whether or not any additional penalty
          payment will apply.
 C2.3     If a break of at least nine continuous hours cannot be provided between shifts, the shift is to be
          regarded as continuous until a break of at least nine continuous hours is taken. Payment for hours
          worked shall be at the appropriate rate taking into account the provisions of section C1.
 C2.4     The penalty payment provisions will not apply in any case where the result would be to give an
          employee a lesser payment than would otherwise have been received.
 C2.5     Time spent off duty during ordinary hours solely to obtain a nine-hour break shall be paid at ordinary
          time rates. Any absence after the ninth hour of such a break, if it occurs in ordinary time, shall be
          treated as a normal absence from duty.

 SECTION D:        REMUNERATION
 D1       JOB EVALUATION BAND REMUNERATION RANGES
 D1.1     The minimum and maximum for the remuneration range of each band will be reviewed by the employer
          on an annual basis against market information. “Confirmed” denotes that the market information for
          each job evaluation band has been obtained, the analysis has been completed and therefore the
          minimum and maximum can be confirmed for that year. “Estimated” denotes that the minimums and
          maximums for each job evaluation band for future years are projected and therefore subject to review
          by the employer and may be either increased or lowered subject to the market information received.
 D1.2     Minimum and maximum rates for each Job Evaluation Band are outlined below with effect from 1
          February 2020. Individual employee salaries will increase by a minimum of 2% on 1 February in 2020,
          2021, and 2022 subject to the remuneration framework criteria. For details please visit the
          Remuneration page on the staff intranet.

 D1.3     All staff will be paid between the minimum and maximum of the remuneration range for their band with
          effect from 1 February 2020, unless they have had their salary capped as a result of being over the
          remuneration range maximum for their position.
 D2       EVALUATION OF POSITIONS
 D2.1     The University uses the Strategic Pay Job Evaluation methodology SP10 and Job Wise system, to
          evaluate the majority of Professional positions across the organisation. The Job Evaluation page
          provides guidance on the purpose and approach; when jobs are evaluated; and how a request is
          made to evaluate a job and potential outcomes. The object is to ensure that the integrity of all job
          evaluation outcomes is maintained.
          Where the position is placed in a higher band and the current salary is below the minimum for that
          band the salary will be raised to at least the minimum from the date that the Job Evaluation was
          confirmed.
          In transferring to a new position, at a lower band than their current position, the employee’s
          current salary will not be reduced unless their current salary is above the maximum for the band
          for the new position. The employee can accept or decline the terms and conditions of any such
          offer.
          Where an employee occupies a position that has been reviewed under the Guidelines for Job
          Evaluation and the band of the position has been increased, the salary of the staff member will be
          automatically reviewed according to the Guidelines for Out of Cycle Increases.
 D2.2     A manager or employee may appeal the outcome of a job evaluation within one month where the job
          description used for the evaluation was inaccurate.
 D3       ANNUAL REVIEWS
 D3.1     Salary Review
          All salaries below the maximum of a band shall be reviewed annually.
 D3.2     Remuneration Principles
           i. Fair – Fair, equitable and transparent;
           ii. Fiscally sustainable – A University that is financially sustainable and responsible to remain
                competitive and autonomous in a constrained environment;
           iii. Flexible – Flexible and agile in practices, process, and guidelines to recognise and reward
                performance;
           iv. Contribution – Ensure performance is rewarded.

 D3.3     Salary review principles
          Reviews shall:
            i.  Be aligned with the values and strategies of the University (including University Equity and
                Development Review policies);
            ii. Both the employee and their manager are responsible for the salary review process;
           iii. Both parties must contribute to ensure clarity and transparency of expectations and what
                is needed to achieve in the position is understood and reached;
          iv.   Both parties are responsible for objective setting, development planning, and progress
                meetings throughout the year before the final annual performance and development review
                evaluation, and shall comply with relevant policies and procedures (see the EVOLVE details on
                the staff intranet);
           v.   Take into account both the development and performance of the employee; and
          vi.   Have a monitoring process to ensure appropriate and consistent application.
 D3.4     Appeal Committee for Salary Reviews
          i. An appeal committee will be established by the employer.
          ii. The committee will consider appeals where a case can be made that there has been a significant
               failure of process which has affected the outcome or where the decision is clearly at odds with the
               evidence.
          iii. The Job Evaluation Appeals Process provides more information on how appeals are managed by the
               employer.
 D3.5    Annual Salary Review Process
         The employer will determine the distribution of annual salary increases and bonus payments.
         D3.5.1 Salary Increases
         An annual increase, the “general revision”, is a percentage increase offered by the employer and
         paid in February. A multiplier is then applied to this percentage increase based on the remuneration
         framework, for staff who joined the University prior to 1 November in the previous calendar year.
          Staff who are paid at or above the maximum for the band in which their position is placed, whose
          performance consistently exceeds identified expectations, will be considered, through the Annual
          Salary Review process, for a lump sum bonus.
          D3.5.2 Bonus Payments
          Bonus payments may be made to individuals or groups who have undertaken substantial additional
          work or special projects over and above normal duties, or in recognition of exemplary performance.
          Applications may be initiated by individuals through their manager or Academic Head
 D4       TE REO DUTIES
          The employer will take into account for remuneration purposes proficiency in languages other than
          English, and Te Reo in particular, where the needs of the job demand such skills.
          Where employees are called upon by the University to use Te Reo Maori in circumstances outside their
          job requirements, and where such duties are above and beyond the normal requirements of the
          employee, the University may recognise such contributions either financially or otherwise.

 E3       FIELD WORK
 E3.1     For the purpose of this agreement, field work shall mean:
          (i)     A day field trip - which does not necessitate the employee being away from his/her place of
                  residence overnight;
          (ii)    A field trip - which necessitates the employee being away from his/her place of residence for

          (iii)   An expedition - which necessitates the employee being away from his/her place of residence for
                  more than 20 consecutive nights.
 E3.2     An employee has the right to object to undertaking field trips and expeditions as defined in
          paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of sub-clause E3.1 on reasonable grounds. The employer undertakes to
          adequately consider an employee's reasonable objection to field trips and expeditions and wherever
          possible to give reasonable notice of the field trip or expedition.
 E3.3     An employee who undertakes field work of any kind covered by this clause shall be provided by the
          employer with equipment and special clothing deemed by the employer to be necessary for the field
          work, and such equipment or special clothing shall remain the property of the employer. In lieu of the
          foregoing, an employee may be paid a sum agreed upon by the employer and the employee as partial
          reimbursement of the cost of provision by the employee of such equipment or special clothing, which
          shall remain the property of the employee.
 E3.4     It shall be the duty of the employer to take all reasonable steps to ensure that all equipment and

          undertaking a field trip or expedition may be given an advance against expenses.
 E3.6     An employee engaged on a day trip shall be entitled to time-off, in lieu of overtime, on the basis of
          one hour for each hour worked, for any hours worked in excess of 7.5 hours.
 E3.7     An employee engaged on a field trip shall be entitled to one day's time off in respect of each day
          worked on that field trip, which is not one of the employee’s regular days of work, to be taken at a
          time mutually convenient to the employee and the employer.
 E3.8     An employee engaged on an expedition shall be entitled to overtime or time-off in lieu for the first

 E3.9     An employee who is engaged on a field trip shall be entitled to accommodation of a reasonable
          standard appropriate to the circumstances.
 E3.10    The terms and conditions applicable to expeditions shall be determined in each case prior to the
          commencement of the expedition. It is recognised by the parties that each expedition is to be treated
          on its merits as a separate case.
 E4       TRANSPORT
 E4.1     Where an employee is required to travel to or from work outside regular hours and the employer
          considers the safety of the employee is at risk the employer may provide free transport.

                Auckland Anniversary Day
                Christmas Day
                Boxing Day
 F1.2     (i)    Where permanent or fixed term employees are required to work on a day on which a public
                 holiday is legally observed, they shall be paid double time for all hours actually worked. If
                 the public holiday worked is an ordinary day of work for the employee, they shall be
                 allowed a paid day off in lieu.
          (ii)   Staff working on Easter Tuesday or the last working day before Christmas shall be paid double
                 time.
 F2       ANNUAL LEAVE
 F2.1     Employees will be entitled to five (5) weeks annual leave (inclusive of Easter Tuesday and the last
          weekday before Christmas) per year of continuous service.
 F2.2     Employees will take annual leave on Easter Tuesday, the last weekday before Christmas and the
          working days between Christmas and New Year, unless otherwise instructed by the Employer.
 F2.3     The employee’s wishes concerning the timing of leave will be met as far as possible. However, where
          this is not convenient to the University, the employer may decline to grant leave or may direct an
          employee to take leave at a certain time. (Decisions regarding timing of leave will be made in
          discussion with the employee and have regard to the University’s workload requirements and the
          relevant University policies and practices.)
 F2.4     Wherever possible employees will have the opportunity to take all leave due to them in any one leave
          year. An employee may be permitted to carry forward from one leave year to the next up to half of
          their annual leave entitlement. With the written approval of the employer an employee may take
          annual leave in anticipation of entitlement. The number of days anticipated shall not exceed the
          amount of accrued leave.
 F2.5     The University will provide at least one block of annual leave of more than two weeks in each year, in
          accordance with the Holidays Act. Staff and managers are encouraged to discuss annual leave plans
          for the forthcoming year.
 F2.6     The University is introducing a pilot scheme in 2020 providing staff with the option to either buy or
          cash up one (1) week of annual leave. For details of this scheme and eligibility requirements please
          visit the Leave Plus page on the staff intranet.
 F3       HOLIDAYS FALLING DURING LEAVE OR TIME OFF
 F3.1     Leave on pay
          Where a public holiday falls during a period of annual leave, sick leave on pay or special leave on pay
          (including special University paid parental leave under clause F7), an employee is entitled to that
          holiday which is not to be debited against such leave. This provision does not apply to a holiday
          falling during annual or retiring leave after the employee has ceased work prior to leaving the
          university, unless the employee has worked at any time during the fortnight prior to the day on which
          the holiday is observed.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                               July 2022
 F3.2     Leave without pay
          An employee shall not be entitled to payment for a public holiday falling during a period of leave
          without pay, unless the employee has worked at any time during the fortnight prior to the day the
          holiday is observed.
 F4       SICK LEAVE
 F4.1     Employees are entitled to either 10 days Sick Leave on pay for each 12 months of service, or Sick
          Leave without pay, on production of a medical certificate.
 F4.2     Sick leave can be used when the employee is sick or injured or when the employee must attend to a
          dependent member of the family, who becomes sick, as set out in the Holidays Act 2003 and its
          subsequent amendments.
 F4.3     All Sick Leave is to be computed in working days.
 F4.4     This leave is inclusive of the provisions of the Holidays Act 2003.
 F4.5     The employer may, at its discretion, decide that sick leave on pay of any special nature should not be
          included in the aggregate of sick leave taken.
 F4.6     If an employee is absent on sick leave for less than a whole day, such leave is to be debited as
          follows:
          (i)    Absent for a whole morning or afternoon - half day's sick leave
          (ii)   Absent for less than two hours during the day - no deduction.
          (iii) Absent for two hours and up to six hours during the day - half day's sick leave.
          (iv) Absent for over six hours during the day - one day's sick leave.
 F4.7     The employee should notify absence due to sickness to the employer whenever possible within 30
          minutes of normal starting time. A medical certificate will be required for all absences in excess of five
          consecutive days and may be required for absences of shorter periods. If information is received
          which indicates that the sick leave entitlement is being misused, the employer may take such action
          as is necessary to clarify the matter.
 F4.8     When sickness occurs during annual or long service leave, the employer will permit the period of
          sickness to be debited against sick leave entitlement provided that period of sickness is more than
          five days and a medical certificate is produced.
 F4.9     Anticipation of Sick Leave
          In special cases, employees may be allowed to anticipate sick leave becoming due on completion of a
          further period of service provided that at least five days sick leave is retained for each year of service
          for which sick leave has been anticipated.
          All approvals are subject to the proviso that the necessary adjustments to final pay are to be made if
          employees resign before the next entitlement falls due in accordance with Clause G5.
 F4.10    Medical Incapacity
          In the event of prolonged illness, suspected incapacity or concerns about the Employees’ attendance
          at work (including as a result of intermittent absences), the Employer may request that an Employee
          undergo an examination by a registered medical practitioner for an assessment of an Employee’s
          fitness for work and/or return to work.
          The parties agree that the primary purpose of any medical examinations is to support the
          Employee’s wellbeing, recovery and return to work. Accordingly, the selection of the relevant
          practitioner, (although nominated by the University) is to be by mutual agreement. The cost of the
          medical examinations will be met by the Employer. A copy of any relevant report provided by the
          agreed medical practitioner will be available to both parties.
          For Employees who are unfit to work but progressing toward recovery and a return to work may be
          granted leave either with or without pay (if an Employee has exhausted their sick leave
          entitlements).
          Where an Employee remains unfit to work after a reasonable timeframe, or prognosis for recovery is
          poor, provided that reasonable time has been given for recovery and the Employer has taken
          practicable steps to support the Employee to return to work, termination of employment may be
          considered.
          In cases where termination of employment is necessary, a notice period of 3 months will be
          applicable.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                           July 2022
 F5       RETIREMENT
 F5.1     The Employee shall give to the University a minimum of three (3) months’ notice of retirement in
          writing.
 F5.2     An Employee who intends to retire may apply for a phased retirement agreement under the terms of
          University policy. Consideration of any application will be subject to the needs and interests of the
          University. Any agreement may cover: dates of retirement and any retirement payment; specified and
          agreed part time and/or fixed-term employment; duties; etc. The Employee shall provide the University
          with details of any planned future employment.
          The University and employee agree that retirement means permanently withdrawing from the paid
          fulltime, part-time, fixed-term or casual workforce. The employee shall provide the University with
          details of any planned future employment.
 F6       RETIREMENT LEAVE
 F6.1     Only Employees who elect to retire on or after the date they are eligible to receive government
          funded superannuation will be entitled to receive the following benefit to supplement their first
          government superannuation payment:
          (i)     after 10 years continuous service – 20 working days
          (ii)    after each additional year up to 25 years - 5 working days
          (iii)   after each additional year over 25 years - 2 working days
          The Employer may at its discretion approve early retirement of a staff member within five (5) years of
          their eligibility for government superannuation without affecting their eligibility for retirement leave.
          The Employer may also agree to retirement on medical grounds subject to the provisions of Section
          F4.10 titled Medical Incapacity. As an exception to F6.1, Employees retiring on medical grounds, before
          they are eligible to receive government funded superannuation may also be entitled to Retirement
          Leave.
 F6.2     Service for the purpose of retirement leave entitlement and calculation means unbroken employment
          with the University, either full-time or part-time (on a pro-rata basis) from the University together with
          any other service which the Employer may at its discretion recognise. However, previous service in the
          State Sector does not qualify for retiring leave if the employee accepted voluntary severance.
 F6.3     Retirement leave does not count as service. Service for retirement leave purposes is to be reckoned up
          to and including the last day of work, plus any annual or long-service leave due.
 F6.4     In determining the period of service, the employer may deduct periods of leave without pay exceeding
          three months in total.
 F6.5     Retirement leave commences from the working day following the last day of work. Where annual leave
          or long-service leave is due, the retiring leave commences from the working day following the expiry of
          such leave.
 F6.6     Grant in Lieu of Retiring Leave
          F6.6.1   All Employees eligible for retiring leave may accept, instead of any period of retiring
          leave to which they are entitled (less any retiring leave already taken in anticipation as part of
          the phased retirement), a lump sum gratuity equivalent in value to that leave. Payment shall be
          made in one gross sum on the date of retirement. Payment will be pro-rated for part time
          Employees to reflect their hours of work.
          F6.6.2     On the death of an Employee, the Employer may approve a cash grant in lieu of
          retiring leave to the Employee’s estate.
 F7       PARENTAL LEAVE
          The provisions below are inclusive of and not in addition to the Parental Leave and Employment
          Protection Act 1987.
 F7.1     Parental Leave including University Paid Parental Leave is administered in accordance with the Parental
          Leave Act. Refer to the University’s Parental Leave Policy and Procedures.
 F7.2      An employee who is entitled to apply for 52 weeks Government Parental Leave may apply for up to 9
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                          July 2022
          (nine) weeks of such Parental Leave as University Paid Parental Leave, providing that the employee
          genuinely intends to return to duty after such Parental Leave, and providing further that if the
          employee subsequently does not return to duties, the employee agrees to refund salary and other
          remuneration paid during University Paid Parental Leave or agrees to alternative arrangements with
          the University. This leave can be taken in blocks of one week or more to allow more flexibility for
          eligible parents.
 F7.3     If both partners are employed in the University and are eligible for Special Paid Parental Leave, then
          they are entitled to a total of nine weeks Special Paid Parental Leave, between them, and they may
          choose who will receive it.
 F8       LONG SERVICE LEAVE
 F8.1     In addition to holidays and annual holidays specified elsewhere in this agreement an employee shall
          be entitled on completion of 20 years continuous university service to a special holiday of 4 (four)
          weeks, which must be taken within five years of becoming due, or be forfeited. This is a once only
          entitlement and must be taken as four consecutive weeks leave.
 F8.2     Long service leave is a leave entitlement, not a basis for a lump sum payment.
 F8.3     Entitlement to long service leave shall not affect any retirement leave eligibility, or retirement grant
          payable under this agreement.
 F9       CREDITING OF PREVIOUS SERVICE
 F9.1     The University may give credit for other previous relevant service for purposes of calculating leave
          and other entitlements (e.g. annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and retiring leave).
 F9.2     Decisions shall have regard to:
          (i)   the relevance of the service;
          (ii)  recruitment and retention experiences.
 F10      JURY SERVICE LEAVE
          An employee called upon for Jury Service must request to be excused where the operational needs of
          the employer require attendance at work. The employer will support that request in writing. If the
          request is refused by the Courts, then the employee called on for Jury Service will be entitled to
          special leave on pay. The employee is to ensure that all fees payable by the court other than for
          service performed on a weekend or rostered day off are paid to the employer. The employee may
          retain any expenses payments.
          For further information on how to apply please view the Types of Leave and How to Apply page on
          the staff intranet.
 F11      BEREAVEMENT/TANGIHANGA LEAVE
 F11.1    An employee shall be granted bereavement leave on full pay to discharge obligations and/or to pay
          respects to a deceased person with whom they have had a close association. Such obligations may
          exist because of blood or family ties or because of particular cultural requirements such as attendance
          at all or part of a Tangihanga (or its equivalent).
 F11.2    In granting time off, and for how long, the employer must administer these provisions in a culturally
          sensitive manner taking into account:
          (i)     the closeness of the association between the employee and the deceased, which association
                  need not be a blood relationship;
          (ii)    whether the employee has to take significant responsibility for any or all of the arrangements to
                  do with the ceremonies resulting from the death;
          (iii)   the amount of time needed to discharge properly any responsibilities or obligations;
          (iv)    reasonable travelling time should be allowed, but for cases involving overseas travel that may
                  not be the full period of travel;
          (v)     a decision must be made as quickly as possible so that the employee is given the maximum
                  time possible to make any necessary arrangements. In most cases the necessary approval will
                  be given immediately, but may be given retrospectively where necessary.
 F11.3    If paid bereavement leave is not appropriate, then annual leave or leave without pay should be
          granted, but as a last resort.
 F11.4    If a bereavement occurs while an employee is absent on annual leave, sick leave on pay, long service
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                                 July 2022
          leave (except when this is taken after relinquishing of office) or other discretionary leave on pay, such
          leave may be interrupted and bereavement leave granted in terms of the preceding clauses. This
          provision will not apply if the employee is on leave without pay.
 F12      STUDY LEAVE
 F12.1    Provision of Study Leave is at the discretion of the employer.
 F12.2    Employees may be granted study leave to enable them to complete qualifications and to attend
          courses and seminars which are considered by their employer to be relevant to their employment.
          Such study leave may entitle them to the benefits set out in F12.3 and F12.4.
 F12.3    An employee who has been granted study leave under the provisions of F12.2, may have their cost of
          tuition paid, either in whole or in part, by the University directly at commencement of each paper or
          papers (where such a course is offered by the University of Auckland). Other fees and purchase of
          notes, books and instruments will remain the responsibility of the employee.
 F12.4    Where the University has paid the employee’s fees and/or other related expenses, and the employee
          fails to successfully complete the paper or papers, (in the absence exceptional circumstances) the
          employee agrees that they may be required to repay the fees as a debt that is owed to the University.
 F12.5   Where, as a course requirement, the employee who has been granted study leave under these
         provisions is required to travel to another centre, the employer may pay transport costs and expenses
         in accordance with University policy.
 F12.6    The granting of study leave each year shall be subject to the employee’s satisfactory progress in
          his/her work and studies.
 F12.7    Where a full time employee is required by the employer to study towards a recognised qualification,
          the employee shall be granted leave on pay up to a maximum of one day in a week, or such other
          times as may be required by the employer, for the purpose of attending such a course or study.
 F13      TUITION FEES
          The University may meet the costs of tuition for any employee enrolled for a course of study in the
          University which is relevant to the employee's work and has been approved by the employer. The
          University may approve attendance at courses in other cases without meeting the cost of tuition.
 F14      OTHER LEAVE
          The employer may grant an employee Other Leave with or without pay on such terms and conditions
          as the employer may deem fit.
 F15      ACCIDENT LEAVE
          Accident leave is granted in terms of Accident Compensation Act 2001.
          The University is committed to paying the first week’s compensation in the case of all injuries
          sustained in the course of employment, even if such injuries are classified otherwise according to the
          Act.
          The University will pay compensation for up to 28 days following the start of incapacity until the claim
          is identified as work related or not. In the case of non-work related accidents, the employee shall
          immediately reimburse the full amount to the employer as soon as they receive compensation from
          ACC in respect of that period.
 F16      PROFESSIONAL FEES
          Subject to the approval of the Director/Dean, the employer may pay professional fees that are
          relevant to the employee’s work in the University, including fees for current practising certificates
          which are necessary to enable the employee to carry out their duties.

          health, safety and wellbeing through continual improvement and the control of risk whilst ensuring
          the continued delivery of world-class education and research. Both the employer and the employee

                  be provided by the employer and the employee instructed in their use.
          (ii)    Where justified prescription hardened lenses shall be provided by the employer. Should a
                  change in prescription require a change of lenses, then the employer shall pay the difference in

                  and shall be carried out on a regular basis.
          (iv)    An employee suffering damage to clothing while wearing protective clothing shall be financially
                  reimbursed for the damage.

                  provided by the employer. Repeated failure to do so shall constitute misconduct.
 G1.4     OOS
          The employer will ensure that all employees are familiar with the risks of OOS when working in
          situations where any muscle group is stressed over periods of time (including through the extended

          particular areas of expertise or responsibility unless they have first obtained the approval of the
          Registrar through the appropriate Dean, Academic Head/HoS or Manager
 G4       PAYMENT OF SALARIES
 G4.1     Direct Debit: Payment of all salaried employees shall be by direct credit to a bank account, fortnightly.
 G4.2     Final Pay: Regardless of whether the termination is on notice or without notice, the employee’s final
          pay is payable in the next available pay cycle, unless the employee requests of the employer in
          writing to receive the final pay on the last day of the employee’s work.
 G5       DEBT RECOVERY
 G5.1     Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this agreement or in law the parties agree that the
          Employer is entitled to make a deduction from the salary (including final pay and holiday pay in the
          case of a termination) of the Employee for a debt lawfully owed to the University.
          Deductions may be made, for example, for time lost through sickness or accident not covered by
          sick leave, unauthorised absence, non-return or damage of University property, default by you,
          holidays taken in advance, overpayment of salary, outstanding debts or money owed to the
          University by you.
          The Employee will be consulted before any deductions are made from pay.
          The Employer agrees that in an ongoing employment relationship where regular deductions from an
          employees’ salary is necessary to discharge the debt, the amount deducted will be fair and
          reasonable, considering the interests of both parties, including whether the proposed amount is
          affordable for the Employee.
 G6       EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
          The Employment Relations Act 2000 requires that all individual agreements contain a plain-
          language explanation of the services and processes available to resolve any employment
          relationship problems.
 G6.1     Employment relationship problems include:
             •  a personal grievance (a claim of unjustifiable dismissal, unjustifiable disadvantage,
                discrimination, sexual or racial harassment, or duress in relation to membership or non-
                membership of a union or employee organisation)
             •  a dispute (about the interpretation, application or operation of an employment agreement)
             •  any other problem relating to or arising out of the employee’s employment relationship with
                the University except matters relating to the fixing of new terms and conditions of
                employment
 G6.2     If the employee believes there is a problem with his or her employment relationship with the
          University, the employee should tell the employee’s manager, either personally or through another
          representative, as soon as possible:
               •  that there is a problem; and
               •  the nature of the problem; and
               •  what action the employee wishes to be taken in relation to the problem.
 G6.3     If for any reason the employee feels unable to raise the matter with his or her manager, other
          suggested contacts are: Dean or Director, the Director or other staff member of Human Resources or,
          the Director Staff Equity.
 G6.4     In the case of a personal grievance, the employee must raise the matter with the employer within 90
          days of the grievance occurring or coming to the employee’s notice, whichever is the later. A written
          submission is preferable but not necessary.
 G6.5     The employee has the right to seek the support and assistance of his or her representative, or
          information from the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Mediation Service at
          any time.
 G6.6     The University will try to resolve the matter through discussion with the employee and/or his or her
          representative.
 G6.7      If the problem cannot be resolved through discussion, then either the employee or the University can
           request assistance from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Mediation
           Services.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                             July 2022
 G6.8     If the problem is not resolved by mediation, the employee may apply to the Employment Relations
          Authority for investigation and determination.
 G6.9     In certain circumstances the decision of the Employment Relations Authority may be appealed by the
          employee or the University to the Employment Court.
 G7       DISCIPLINARY PRINCIPLES
 G7.1     Disciplinary processes shall be undertaken in accordance with the Disciplinary Procedures for
 G7.2     Procedural Fairness
          The employer must have good grounds to discipline and/or dismiss and any disciplinary process needs
          to be procedurally fair. Procedural fairness requires that the Employee will:
          1.    Be fully and fairly informed of the allegation or allegations against them;
          2.    Have an informed, full and fair opportunity to respond to the alleged breaches of conduct/ poor
                performance, including by being:
                       i. provided with all information generated by the investigation;
                     ii. notified of potential disciplinary outcomes at the outset; and
                    iii. given the opportunity to comment on any proposed penalties and raise any matters
                          relevant to mitigation, prior to a final decision being made.
          3.    Have their responses considered with an open mind;
          4.    Be provided with an opportunity, within a specified time frame to correct the
                conduct/performance, with the assistance and support of the employer (except in the case of
                serious misconduct or after a final written warning);
          5.    Have the right to representation at all stages of the process.
          The Employer also agrees that:
          1.   Any delegate or investigator appointed to conduct an investigation will investigate fully, fairly and
                impartially;
          2.   Any warnings will be issued with the approval of a Human Resources manager or advisor; and
          3.   In circumstances where disciplinary action is taken, the decision and the reasons for it, will be
                provided in writing to the employee; and
          4.   Employees shall be advised of their right to challenge any disciplinary decision.
          Good faith
          Both the employer and employee will act in good faith during any disciplinary process. Both parties
          agree to conduct themselves in a manner that is active, constructive, responsive and communicative to
          ensure that a productive employment relationship is maintained through the process.
 G7.3     Definitions
          “Misconduct” means
          The failure of an employee in their employment to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct or
          concern for the public interest or the wellbeing of the students or other employees of the University;
          or The failure of an employee to comply with policies, procedures or directions of the University,
          Academic Head or other persons in authority at the University; or The failure to maintain adequate
          standards of performance.
          “Serious Misconduct” means
          Misconduct which is so serious that it may warrant summary dismissal and may include but is not
          limited to, sexual harassment, assault, theft, fraud, misappropriation, deliberate or repeated disregard
          of health and safety standards, wilful disobedience, deliberate or repeated misconduct, failure to
          disclose a conflict of interest, breach of the University’s policy against harassment, or behaviour
          which leads to significant loss of trust and confidence.
 G8       SUSPENSION
          Where there is an alleged case of serious misconduct the employee may be suspended on base salary
          from their duties while an investigation is carried out. In addition there may be other exceptional
          circumstances in which an employee may be suspended with pay. Suspensions without pay will only
          occur in very rare and exceptional circumstances, such as a police investigation of serious criminality,
          and cognisant of the presumption of innocence. However no suspension shall be initiated or continued
          unless it is fair and reasonable for such a step to be taken or continued.
           Where there is a proposal to suspend an employee, that employee shall wherever practicable have
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                           July 2022
          the right to have access to all of the relevant information and an opportunity to be heard before the
          suspension occurs.
 G9       CONFIDENTIALITY
          The employee shall not disclose to any person personal information pertaining to either staff or
          students or other information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act and the Official Information
          Act. The employee shall not comment on behalf of the University on matters of a public interest
          outside their particular area of expertise or responsibility unless they have first obtained the specific
          approval of the Director/Dean/University Librarian through the appropriate academic head or
          manager.
 G10      INDEMNIFICATION
          The employer shall keep the employee indemnified from and against all actions, claims, proceedings,
          costs and damages incurred or arising out or any act of omission or statement of the employee in the
          course of his/her employment, provided that this indemnity shall not be available to an employee who
          wilfully causes loss or damage or fails to act in good faith.
 G11      ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYMENT
          When an employee is absent from work for a continuous period of three working days without
          notification to the employer, the employee shall be deemed to have abandoned employment. Where
          an employee was unable through no fault of that employee to notify the employer, employment shall
          not be deemed to have been abandoned.
 G12      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 G12.1    Written notice of termination shall be three (3) months by either party but this may be reduced by
          mutual agreement. This shall not prevent the employer from summarily dismissing an employee for
          misconduct.
 G12.2    Each employee upon termination shall on request be provided with a certificate of service within a
          reasonable period.
 G12.3    Where there is a potential redundancy situation, the provisions of Appendix A shall apply.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                               July 2022
 APPENDIX A: REDUNDANCY PROVISIONS
 (a)   Where the employer carries out a review or restructure of any of the positions covered by this
       agreement, and such a review or restructure has the potential to affect the job security of any employee
       covered by this agreement, the employer will enter into a process of consultation with the affected
       employee(s). Such consultation shall commence not less than one month prior to any final decisions
       being made provided that in specific instances this period may be reduced by mutual agreement with
       the employee(s) concerned. The purpose of such consultation is to allow the parties sufficient
       opportunity to investigate options in good faith which would prevent any loss of employment.
 (b)   The University’s approach to surplus situations shall be to explore the possibility of using redeployment,
       retraining and or alternatively early retirement. Where reasonable efforts to place surplus staff through
       these options prove unsuccessful redundancy provisions may be invoked.
 (c)   Employees shall receive not less than two months’ notice of the termination of their employment by
       reason of redundancy, or such shorter or longer period as may be agreed between the employee and the
       University. They shall have the option to work out their notice where that is practicable.
 (d)   Employees who have been given notice of redundancy will within the period of notice be given reasonable
       time, on full pay to make arrangements to seek new employment. These arrangements may include, for
       example, help in the preparation of a CV, job training, counselling, financial management, or attendance
       at job interviews. The employer will meet reasonable costs.
       Employment Protection Provisions
       Note: This clause shall apply in the event of restructuring of the Employer’s business.
 (e)   This clause applies to restructuring (as defined in Section 69OI of the Employment Relations Act 2000)
       and therefore will apply where the Employer intends to enter into a contract or arrangement under which
       its business (or part of it) is to be undertaken by another person or business, or where the Employer’s
       business (or part of it) is to be sold or transferred to another person or business.
       In the event a restructuring will affect employees, the Employer shall, as soon as is reasonably
       practicable, (taking into account the commercial and confidentiality requirements of the business),
       commence negotiations with the other party involved in the restructuring (the “Other Party”) concerning
       the impact of the restructuring on every employee.
       In those negotiations, the Employer will, subject to any statutory, commercial confidence or privacy
       issues, provide the Other Party with all information about the employees who will be affected by the
       restructuring, including details of their current terms and conditions of employment. The Employer will
       encourage the Other Party to offer all affected employees, employment on no less favourable terms and
       conditions of employment than they currently enjoy with the University.
       However, whether the Other Party offers an employee ongoing employment and on what terms and
       conditions, will ultimately be the decision of that Other Party.
       Two options may be offered. They are:
       •      The Other Party does offer the employee employment on terms and conditions which are no less
              favourable than their existing terms and conditions. The employee may accept this offer to transfer
              to the Other Party or the staff member may decline the offer. If the employee accepts or declines
              the offer then they will not be entitled to any redundancy compensation from the University.
       •      If the staff member is not offered employment, by the Other Party, then the Employer will consult
              with the staff member regarding whether there are any suitable alternative positions available. If
              none can be identified or offered to the employee then they will be entitled to two months’ notice
              and redundancy compensation as per Appendix A (l) in this agreement.
       Redeployment:
 (f)   The conditions under which employees may be redeployed to alternative duties within the University are
       as follows:
       (i)    Employees may be deployed to a position at the same, higher or lower salary;
       (ii)   Where the new position is at a lower salary, an equalisation allowance will be paid for a period of
              two years to preserve the salary of the employee in the old position at the time of redeployment.
 (g)   The equalisation allowance will be paid as an on-going allowance for two years equivalent to the
       difference between the present salary and the new salary. The allowance will be abated by any salary
       increase for the new position during the two year period.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                               July 2022
 (h)   Employees who are offered a position in the University which by mutual agreement is comparable to their
       existing position, noting that such agreement is not to be unreasonably withheld, and who decline
       appointment, will not be eligible for redundancy compensation.
 (i)   Where an employee agrees to be redeployed into a position that is not comparable to their existing
       position, or the employee has accepted a comparable position that is subsequently found by the
       employee to be not comparable to their existing position in good faith, the employee may within the first
       three months in the new position and after consultation with the employer to explore other options, elect
       to resign from it, by giving the appropriate notice. The employee will receive a severance payment
       calculated on the salary and service of the employee immediately prior to the time s/he was initially
       redeployed.
 (j)   Employees who receive redundancy compensation and are re-employed by the University in a
       permanent or fixed term capacity within twelve (12) months of termination of employment, may be
       required to pay back any redundancy compensation they received. In the case of a permanent
       employment, an employee may be required to pay all or some of their compensation abating on a pro
       rata basis subject to the length of time that has elapsed since their final day of employment with the
       University. In the case of a fixed term appointment, employees will be required pay back some or all
       their redundancy compensation subject to the length of the offer of fixed term employment in
       accordance with (k) below.
 (k)   In the case of redeployment into a fixed term position which by mutual agreement is comparable to their
       existing position and which then ceases to exist, and the employee is not further redeployed, the
       employee’s employment agreement shall terminate and the employee will be paid severance on the
       following basis:
       (i)    Where the position ceases during the first 12 months of redeployment the full severance payment
       will be made at the end of the fixed term;
       (ii)    Where the position ceases after a period in excess of one year but not exceeding two years of
               redeployment, 50% of the severance payment will be made at the end of the fixed term;
       (iii)   Where the position ceases beyond two years of redeployment no severance payment will be made.
       Redundancy:
 (l)   Upon leaving the University because of redundancy the employee shall be offered a severance payment
       as follows based on continuous service with the University.
       (a)     Six weeks ordinary pay for the first year (or less) of service to the University.
       (b)     Two weeks ordinary pay for the second and subsequent years or part thereof.
       The maximum severance payment under this clause shall be 40 weeks ordinary pay.
       Annual leave and Long Service Leave due shall be paid in addition to the above payment.
 (m)   Severance payment for a fixed term position that ceases to exist will be calculated on the basis of salary
       and service of the employee, and will not be greater than the salary that would be due over the
       unexpired portion of the term.
 (n)   Where the employment of an employee engaged in an activity of the University comes to an end because
       that activity is sold or transferred and the person who acquires that activity offers to employ that
       employee:
       (a)     on conditions that are the same as or no less favourable than the existing conditions; and
       (b)     on the basis that service with the University is treated as if it were service with the new employer
               and as if it were continuous;
       and the employee accepts the offer then the employee shall not be entitled to any severance payment
       under clause (k) of this agreement.
       Where the employee declines to accept the position, the employee will consult with the employer over
       redeployment and other options contained in clauses (e) to (k), including the following option.
       Where the person acquiring the activity offers a different role or employment on less favourable terms
       and conditions, the employee(s) may, at their sole option, negotiate with the University over the
       terms and conditions surrounding termination of employment with the University and acceptance of
       employment with the new employer.

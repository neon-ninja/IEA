 SECTION D:         REMUNERATION
 D1       EVALUATION OF POSITIONS
 D1.1   The University uses the Strategic Pay Job Evaluation methodology SP10 and Job Wise system to
         evaluate the majority of Professional positions across the organisation. The Guidelines for Job
         Evaluation provide guidance on the purpose and approach, when jobs are evaluated, how a request
         is made to evaluate a job and potential outcomes. The object is to ensure that the integrity of all
         job evaluation outcomes is maintained.
 D1.2   Where the position is placed in a higher band and the current salary is below the minimum for that
         band the salary will be raised to at least the minimum from the date that the Job Evaluation was
         confirmed. In such cases, the salary of the staff member will also be reviewed according to
         guidelines for Out of Cycle Salary Review.
 D2       APPEALS AGAINST THE JOB EVALUATION BAND OUTCOME
 D2.1    A manager or staff member may appeal within one month of the evaluation of a position where the
         job description used for the evaluation was inaccurate.
 D3       JOB EVALUATION BAND REMUNERATION RANGES
 D3.1    Minimum and maximum for each Job Evaluation Band with effect from 1 February 2023 can be
          found on the University’s Remuneration Intranet page:

                     collective and the Employer’s fiscal position.
          D3.1.2    Remuneration ranges for 2024 will be increased by a minimum of 3% and ranges will be
                    posted on the remuneration intranet page once confirmed.
 D3.2    All staff will be paid between the minimum and maximum of the remuneration range for their band
          unless they have had their salary capped as a result of being over the remuneration range
          maximum for their position.
 D4       ANNUAL SALARY REVIEWS
 D4.1     All salaries shall be reviewed annually.
 D4.2     Development and Salary Review Principles

              i.   be aligned with the values, strategies and policies of the University, including equity and
                   development policies;
              ii. Both the staff member and their manager are responsible for the salary review process and
                   shall comply with relevant policies and procedures (currently Tupu);
              iii. Both parties must contribute to ensure clarity and transparency of expectations including
                   what is required to achieve in the position;
              iv. Both parties are responsible for objective setting, development planning and progress
                   meetings throughout the year before the final annual performance and development
                   review; The manager shall review annually the development, performance and salary of
                   the Employee, taking into account evidence of competency in performance. The University
                   will have a monitoring process to ensure appropriate and consistent application.
 D4.3     Process
          D4.3.1    Salary Increases
                    An annual percentage increase to salary, the “general revision”, is paid in February. A
                    multiplier is then applied to the percentage increase based on the remuneration
                    framework, subject to Tupu performance for staff who joined the University prior to 1
                    November in the previous calendar year.
                    Staff who are paid at or above the maximum for the Band in which their position is placed,
                    whose performance consistently exceeds identified expectations, will be considered,
                    through the Annual Salary Review process, for a lump sum payment or bonus.

                   exemplary performance. Applications may be initiated by individuals through their
                   manager.

          An employee shall not be entitled to payment for a public holiday falling during a period of leave
          without pay, unless the Employee has worked at any time during the fortnight prior to the day the
          holiday is observed.

 F4       SICK LEAVE
 F4.1    Employees are entitled to either 10 days Sick Leave on pay for each 12 months of service, or Sick
          Leave without pay, on production of a medical certificate.
 F4.2     Sick leave can be used when the Employee is sick or injured or when the Employee must attend to
          a dependent member of the family, who becomes sick, as set out in the Holidays Act 2003 and its
          subsequent amendments.
 F4.3     All Sick Leave is to be computed in working days.
 F4.4     This leave is inclusive of the provisions of the Holidays Act 2003.
 F4.5     The Employer may, at its discretion, decide that sick leave on pay of any special nature should not
          be included in the aggregate of sick leave taken.
 F4.6     If an employee is absent on sick leave for less than a whole day, such leave is to be debited as
          follows:
          (i)     Absent for a quarter of the total allotted hours for that day – no deduction
          (ii)    Absent for between a quarter and three quarters of the total allotted hours for that day - half
                  day's sick leave
          (iii)   Absent for more than three quarters of the total allotted hours for that day – full day’s sick
                  leave.
 F4.7    The Employee should notify absence due to sickness to the Employer whenever possible within 30
          minutes of normal starting time. A medical certificate will be required for all absences in excess of
          five consecutive days and may be required for absences of shorter periods. If information is received
          which indicates that the sick leave entitlement is being misused, the Employer may take such action
          as is necessary to clarify the matter.
 F4.8    When sickness occurs during annual or long service leave, the Employer will permit the period of
          sickness to be debited against sick leave entitlement provided that period of sickness is more than
          five days and a medical certificate is produced.
 F4.9     Anticipation of Sick Leave
          In special cases, employees may be allowed to anticipate sick leave becoming due on completion
          of a further period of service provided that at least five days sick leave is retained for each year of
          service for which sick leave has been anticipated      .
 F4.10    All approvals are subject to the proviso that the necessary adjustments to final pay are to be made
          if employees resign before the next entitlement falls due in accordance with Clause G5.
 F4.11    Medical Incapacity
          F4.11.1 In the event of prolonged illness, suspected incapacity or concerns about the Employee’s
                  attendance at work (including as a result of intermittent absences), the Employer may
                  request that an Employee undergo an examination by a registered medical practitioner
                  for an assessment of an Employee’s fitness for work and/or return to work.
          F4.11.2 The parties agree that the primary purpose of any medical examinations is to support the
                  Employee’s wellbeing, recovery and return to work. Accordingly, the selection of the
                  relevant practitioner, (although nominated by the University) is to be by mutual
                  agreement. The cost of the medical examinations will be met by the Employer. A copy of
                  any relevant report provided by the agreed medical practitioner will be available to both
                  parties.
          F4.11.3 For Employees who are unfit to work but progressing toward recovery and a return to
                  work may be granted leave either with or without pay (if an Employee has exhausted their
                  sick leave entitlements).
          F4.11.4 Where an Employee remains unfit to work after a reasonable timeframe, or prognosis for
                  recovery is poor, provided that reasonable time has been given for recovery and the
                  Employer has taken practicable steps to support the Employee to return to work,
                  termination of employment may be considered.
          F4.11.5 In cases where termination of employment is necessary, a notice period of 3 months will
                  be applicable.

 F5       PARENTAL LEAVE
 F5.1     The University recognises and affirms the importance of whānau by providing an inclusive parental
          leave policy to support parents, in line with the Parental Leave Act.
 F5.2   University Paid Parental Leave is administered in accordance with the University’s Parental Leave
         Policy and Procedures.
 F5.3   Staff members may apply for up to nine weeks of University Paid Parental leave if they meet the
         criteria in the Parental Leave Policy and Procedures.
 F5.4     University Paid Parental Leave can be taken in blocks of one week or more to allow more flexibility
          for eligible parents.
 F6       RETIREMENT
 F6.1   The Employee shall give to the University a minimum of three (3) months’ notice of retirement in
         writing.
 F6.2    An Employee who intends to retire may apply for a phased retirement agreement under the terms
         of University policy. Consideration of any application will be subject to the needs and interests of
         the University. Any agreement may cover: dates of retirement and any retirement payment;
         specified and agreed part time and/or fixed-term employment; duties; etc. The Employee shall
         provide the University with details of any planned future employment.
          The University and employee agree that retirement means permanently withdrawing from the paid
          fulltime, part-time, fixed-term or casual workforce. The Employee shall provide the University with
          details of any planned future employment.
 F7       RETIREMENT LEAVE
          Employees who commence employment on or after 1 February 2023 will not be eligible for the
          retirement leave condition (the Condition).
          The Condition is grandparented for staff who were employees on or before 31 January 2023 as follows:
          Employees of the University whose employment has been terminated (by way of resignation, redundancy
          or the end of a fixed-term contract) between 1 February 2017 to 31 January 2023 will be entitled to the
          Condition if they re-join the University on or after 1 February 2023 provided that they meet the following
          criteria (the Criteria):
                  o     The employee has not previously received the Condition on termination;
                  o     They inform the University that they were previously employed by the University and meet the
                        Criteria.
                  o     For those employees who are eligible to access the grandparented Condition, continuous service
                        for the calculation of the Condition will start from the date at which they recommenced
                        employment at the University
 F7.1   Only Employees who elect to retire on or after the date they are eligible to receive government
         funded superannuation will be entitled to receive the following benefit to supplement their first
         government superannuation payment:
          (i)         after 10 years continuous service – 20 working days
          (ii)        after each additional year up to 25 years - 5 working days
          (iii)       after each additional year over 25 years - 2 working days
          The Employer may at its discretion approve early retirement of a staff member within five (5) years
          of their eligibility for government superannuation without affecting their eligibility for retirement
          leave.
          The Employer may also agree to retirement on medical grounds subject to the provisions of Section
          F4.11 titled Medical Incapacity. As an exception to F7.1, Employees retiring on medical grounds,
          before they are eligible to receive government funded superannuation may also be entitled to
          Retirement Leave.
 F7.2    Service for the purpose of retirement leave entitlement and calculation means unbroken
          employment with the University, either full-time or part-time (on a pro-rata basis) from the
          University together with any other service which the Employer may at its discretion recognise.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                            December 2022
          However, previous service in the State Sector does not qualify for retiring leave if the Employee
          accepted voluntary severance.
 F7.3    Retirement leave does not count as service. Service for retirement leave purposes is to be reckoned
          up to and including the last day of work, plus any annual or long-service leave due.
 F7.4    In determining the period of service, the Employer may deduct periods of leave without pay
          exceeding three months in total.
 F7.5    Retirement leave commences from the working day following the last day of work. Where annual
          leave or long-service leave is due, the retiring leave commences from the working day following
          the expiry of such leave.
 F7.6     Grant in Lieu of Retiring Leave
          F7.6.1   All Employees eligible for retiring leave may accept, instead of any period of retiring leave
                   to which they are entitled (less any retiring leave already taken in anticipation as part of
                   the phased retirement), a lump sum gratuity equivalent in value to that leave. Payment
                   shall be made in one gross sum on the date of retirement. Payment will be pro-rated for
                   part time Employees to reflect their hours of work.
          F7.6.2   On the death of an Employee, the Employer may approve a cash grant in lieu of retiring
                    leave to the Employee’s estate.
 F8       LONG SERVICE LEAVE
 F8.1    In addition to holidays and annual holidays specified elsewhere in this agreement an employee shall
          be entitled on completion of 20 years continuous university service to a special holiday of 4 (four)
          weeks, which must be taken within five years of becoming due, or be forfeited. This is a once only
          entitlement. The employee’s wishes concerning the timing of leave will be met as far as possible.
          Employees may elect to take this as four consecutive weeks leave, or in one-week blocks.
 F8.2     Long service leave is a leave entitlement, not a basis for a lump sum payment.
 F8.3    Entitlement to long service leave shall not affect any retirement leave eligibility, or retirement grant
          payable under this agreement.
 F9       CREDITING OF PREVIOUS SERVICE
 F9.1    The University may give credit for other previous relevant service for purposes of calculating leave
          and other entitlements (e.g. annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and retiring leave).
 F9.2     Decisions shall have regard to:
          (i)    the relevance of the service;
          (ii)   recruitment and retention experiences.
 F10      JURY SERVICE LEAVE
 F10.1    An employee called upon for Jury Service may request to be excused where the operational needs
          of the Employer require attendance at work. The Employer will support that request in writing where
          the Employer agrees that its operational needs require the Employee’s attendance at work.. If the
          request is refused by the Courts, then the Employee called on for Jury Service will be entitled to
          special leave on pay. The Employee is to ensure that all fees payable by the court other than for
          service performed on a weekend or rostered day off are paid to the Employer. The Employee may
          retain any expenses payments.
 F10.2    For further information on how to apply please view the Types of Leave and How to Apply page on
          the staff intranet.
 F11      BEREAVEMENT/TANGIHANGA LEAVE
 F11.1    An employee shall be granted bereavement leave on full pay to discharge obligations and/or to pay
          respects to a deceased person with whom they have had a close association. Such obligations may
          exist because of blood or family ties or because of particular cultural requirements such as
          attendance at all or part of a Tangihanga (or its equivalent).
 F11.2    In granting time off, and for how long, the Employer must administer these provisions in a culturally
           sensitive manner taking into account:
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                            December 2022
          (i)     the closeness of the association between the Employee and the deceased, which association
                  need not be a blood relationship;
          (ii)    whether the Employee has to take significant responsibility for any or all of the arrangements
                  to do with the ceremonies resulting from the death;
          (iii)   the amount of time needed to discharge properly any responsibilities or obligations;
          (iv)    reasonable travelling time should be allowed, but for cases involving overseas travel that
                  may not be the full period of travel;
          (v)     a decision must be made as quickly as possible so that the Employee is given the maximum
                  time possible to make any necessary arrangements. In most cases the necessary approval
                  will be given immediately, but may be given retrospectively where necessary.
 F11.3   If paid bereavement leave is not appropriate, then annual leave or leave without pay should be
           granted, but as a last resort.
 F11.4   If a bereavement occurs while an employee is absent on annual leave, sick leave on pay, long
          service leave (except when this is taken after relinquishing of office) or other discretionary leave on
          pay, such leave may be interrupted and bereavement leave granted in terms of the preceding
          clauses. This provision will not apply if the Employee is on leave without pay.
 F12      STUDY LEAVE
 F12.1    Provision of Study Leave is at the discretion of the Employer.
 F12.2   Employees may be granted study leave to enable them to complete qualifications and to attend
          courses and seminars which are considered by their employer to be relevant to their employment.
          Such study leave may entitle them to the benefits set out in F12.3 and F12.4.
 F12.3   An employee who has been granted study leave under the provisions of F12.2, may have their cost
         of tuition paid, either in whole or in part, by the University directly at commencement of each
         courses or courses (where such a course is offered by Waipapa Taumata Rau | The University of
         Auckland). Other fees and purchase of notes, books and instruments will remain the responsibility
         of the Employee.
 F12.4   Where the University has paid the Employee’s fees and/or other related expenses, and the
          Employee fails to successfully complete the course or courses, (in the absence exceptional
          circumstances) the Employee agrees that they may be required to repay the fees as a debt that is
          owed to the University.
 F12.5   Where, as a course requirement, the Employee who has been granted study leave under these
          provisions is required to travel to another centre, the Employer may pay transport costs and
          expenses in accordance with University policy.
 F12.6    The granting of study leave each year shall be subject to the Employee’s satisfactory progress in
          his/her work and studies.
 F12.7    Where a full time employee is required by the Employer to study towards a recognisedqualification,
          the Employee shall be granted leave on pay up to a maximum of one day in a week, or such other
          times as may be required by the Employer, for the purpose of attending such a course or study.
 F13      TUITION FEES
 F13.1   The University may meet the costs of tuition for any employee enrolled for a course of study in the
         University which is relevant to the Employee's work and has been approved by the Employer. The

 F14      OTHER LEAVE

         as the Employer may deem fit.
 F15      ACCIDENT LEAVE
 F15.1    Accident leave is granted in terms of Accident Compensation Act 2001.
 F15.2    The University is committed to paying the first week’s compensation in the case of all injuries
          sustained in the course of employment, even if such injuries are classified otherwise according to
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                            December 2022
          the Act.
 F15.3    The University will pay compensation for up to 28 days following the start of incapacity until the
          claim is identified as work related or not. In the case of non-work related accidents, the Employee
          shall immediately reimburse the full amount to the Employer as soon as they receive compensation
          from ACC in respect of that period.
 F16      FAMILY VIOLENCE LEAVE
 F16.1    The University supports staff who are affected by family violence. Family violence is defined in the

 G2.2    Staff are encouraged to engage with their manager where there are actual or proposed changes in
         job content and responsibility.
 G2.3    Where there are significant changes in the position, the Job Description may be reviewed and may

          A.
 G3       RELEASE OF INFORMATION
 G3.1    Employees shall ensure that they do not comment on behalf of the University unless they have first

         reasonable, considering the interests of both parties, including whether the proposed amount is
         affordable for the Employee.

 G6       EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
          The Employment Relations Act 2000 requires that all individual agreements contain a plain-
          language explanation of the services and processes available to resolve any employment
          relationship problems.
 G6.1     Employment relationship problems include:
                    a personal grievance (a claim of unjustifiable dismissal, unjustifiable disadvantage,
                     discrimination, sexual or racial harassment, or duress in relation to membership or non-
                     membership of a union or employee organisation)
                    a dispute (about the interpretation, application or operation of an employment agreement)
                    any other problem relating to or arising out of the Employee’s employment relationship with
                     the University except matters relating to the fixing of new terms and conditions of
                     employment.
 G6.2     If the Employee believes there is a problem with his or her employment relationship with the
          University, the Employee should tell the Employee’s manager, either personally or through another
          representative, as soon as possible:
                 that there is a problem; and
                 the nature of the problem; and
                 what action the Employee wishes to be taken in relation to the problem.
 G6.3    In the case of a personal grievance (other than for sexual harassment), the Employee must raise
          the matter with the Employer within 90 days of the grievance occurring or coming to the
          Employee’s notice, whichever is the later. A written submission is preferable but not necessary.

          the Employee or the University to the Employment Court.

 G7.1   Disciplinary processes shall be undertaken in accordance with the Disciplinary Procedures for
 G7.2     Procedural Fairness
          The Employer must have good grounds to discipline and/or dismiss and any disciplinary process

Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                 December 2022
           (f)   Have the right to representation at all stages of the process.
G7.3     The Employer also agrees that:
           (a)   Any delegate or investigator appointed to conduct an investigation will investigate fully, fairly
                 and impartially;
           (b)   Any warnings will be issued with the approval of a Human Resources manager or advisor;
                 and
           (c)   In circumstances where disciplinary action is taken, the decision and the reasons for it, will
                 be provided in writing to the Employee; and
           (d)   Employees shall be advised of their right to challenge any disciplinary decision.
 G7.4      Good faith
           Both the Employer and employee will act in good faith during any disciplinary process. Both parties
           agree to conduct themselves in a manner that is active, constructive, responsive and communicative
           to ensure that a productive employment relationship is maintained through the process.

                        integrity, conduct or concern for the public interest or the wellbeing of the students or
                        other employees of the University; or
                    (b) The failure of an employee to comply with policies, procedures or directions of the
                        University, Academic Head or other persons in authority at the University; or

           G7.5.2   Serious Misconduct means
                    (a) Misconduct which is so serious that it may warrant summary dismissal and may
                        include but is not limited to, sexual harassment, assault, theft, fraud,
                        misappropriation, deliberate or repeated disregard of health and safety standards,
                        wilful disobedience, deliberate or repeated misconduct, failure to disclose a conflict of
                        interest, breach of the University’s policy against harassment, behaviour which leads

                        University policies.
 G8        SUSPENSION
 G8.1     Where there is an alleged case of serious misconduct the Employee may be suspended on base
          salary from their duties while an investigation is carried out. In addition there may be other
          exceptional circumstances in which an employee may be suspended with pay.
 G8.2     Suspensions without pay will only occur in very rare and exceptional circumstances, such as a police
           investigation of serious criminality, and cognisant of the presumption of innocence. However no
           suspension shall be initiated or continued unless it is fair and reasonable for such a step to be taken
           or continued.
 G8.3      Where there is a proposal to suspend an employee, that employee shall wherever practicable have
           the right to have access to all of the relevant information and an opportunity to be heard before
           the suspension occurs.
 G9        CONFIDENTIALITY
 G9.1      The Employee shall not disclose or share personal information pertaining to either staff or
           students or other information covered by the Provisions of the Privacy Act 2020 or the Official
           Information Act 1982.
 G10       INDEMNIFICATION
 G10.1    The Employer shall keep the Employee indemnified from and against all actions, claims,
           proceedings, costs and damages incurred or arising out or any act of omission or statement of the
           Employee in the course of his/her employment, provided that this indemnity shall not be available
           to an employee who wilfully causes loss or damage or fails to act in good faith.

 G11      ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYMENT
 G11.1 When an employee is absent from work for a continuous period of three working days without
        notification to the Employer, the Employee shall be deemed to have abandoned employment. Where
        an employee was unable through no fault of that employee to notify the Employer, employment
        shall not be deemed to have been abandoned.
 G12      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 G12.1   Written notice of termination shall be three (3) months by either party but this may be reduced by
         mutual agreement. This shall not prevent the Employer from summarily dismissing an employee
         for misconduct.
 G12.2   Each employee upon termination shall on request be provided with a certificate of service within a
          reasonable period.
 G12.3    Where there is a potential redundancy situation, the provisions of Appendix A shall apply.
 G12.4 If the Employee’s employment is terminated, or the Employee retires or resigns, they shall have the
         option to work out their notice period where that is practicable. The Employer shall make a payment
         in lieu of notice to the Employee, where the Employer determines it is not practicable for the
         Employee to work out their notice period.

 APPENDIX A: REDUNDANCY PROVISIONS
 (a)   Where the Employer carries out a review or restructure of any of the positions covered by this
       agreement, and such a review or restructure has the potential to affect the job security of any
       employee covered by this agreement, the Employer will enter into a process of consultation with the
       affected employee(s). Such consultation shall commence not less than one month prior to any final
       decisions being made provided that in specific instances this period may be reduced by mutual
       agreement with the Employee(s) concerned. The purpose of such consultation is to allow the parties
       sufficient opportunity to investigate options in good faith which would prevent any loss of employment.
 (b)   The University’s approach to surplus situations shall be to explore the possibility of using
       redeployment, retraining and or alternatively early retirement. Where reasonable efforts to place
       surplus staff through these options prove unsuccessful redundancy provisions may be invoked.
 (c)   Employees shall receive not less than two months’ notice of the termination of their employment by
       reason of redundancy, or such shorter or longer period as may be agreed between the Employee and
       the University. They shall have the option to work out their notice where that is practicable.
 (d)   Employees who have been given notice of redundancy will within the period of notice be given
       reasonable time, on full pay to make arrangements to seek new employment. These arrangements
       may include, for example, help in the preparation of a CV, job training, counselling, financial
       management, or attendance at job interviews. The Employer will meet reasonable costs.
       Employment Protection Provisions
       Note: This clause shall apply in the event of restructuring of the Employer’s business.
 (e)   This clause applies to restructuring (as defined in Section 69OI of the Employment Relations Act 2000)
       and therefore will apply where the Employer intends to enter into a contract or arrangement under
       which its business (or part of it) is to be undertaken by another person or business, or where the
       Employer’s business (or part of it) is to be sold or transferred to another person or business.
       In the event a restructuring will affect employees, the Employer shall, as soon as is reasonably
       practicable, (taking into account the commercial and confidentiality requirements of the business),
       commence negotiations with the other party involved in the restructuring (the “Other Party”)
       concerning the impact of the restructuring on every employee.
       In those negotiations, the Employer will, subject to any statutory, commercial confidence or privacy
       issues, provide the Other Party with all information about the Employees who will be affected by the
       restructuring, including details of their current terms and conditions of employment. The Employer will
       encourage the Other Party to offer all affected employees, employment on no less favourable terms
       and conditions of employment than they currently enjoy with the University.
       However, whether the Other Party offers an employee ongoing employment and on what terms and
       conditions, will ultimately be the decision of that Other Party.
       Two options may be offered. They are:
       •      The Other Party does offer the Employee employment on terms and conditions which are no less
              favourable than their existing terms and conditions. The Employee may accept this offer to
              transfer to the Other Party or the staff member may decline the offer. If the Employee accepts
              or declines the offer then they will not be entitled to any redundancy compensation from the
              University.
       •      If the staff member is not offered employment, by the Other Party, then the Employer will consult
              with the staff member regarding whether there are any suitable alternative positions available. If
              none can be identified or offered to the Employee then they will be entitled to two months’ notice
              and redundancy compensation as per Appendix A (l) in this agreement.
       Redeployment:
 (f)   The conditions under which employees may be redeployed to alternative duties within the University are
       as follows:
       (i)    Employees may be deployed to a position at the same, higher or lower salary;
       (ii)   Where the new position is at a lower salary, an equalisation allowance will be paid for a period of
              two years to preserve the salary of the Employee in the old position at the time ofredeployment.
 (g)   The equalisation allowance will be paid as an on-going allowance for two years equivalent to the
       difference between the present salary and the new salary. The allowance will be abated by any salary
       increase for the new position during the two year period.
Professional Individual Employment Agreement – Bands H – L                                          December 2022
 (h)   Employees who are offered a position in the University which by mutual agreement is comparable to
       their existing position, noting that such agreement is not to be unreasonably withheld, and who decline
       appointment, will not be eligible for redundancy compensation.
 (i)   Where an employee agrees to be redeployed into a position that is not comparable to their existing
       position, or the Employee has accepted a comparable position that is subsequently found by the
       Employee to be not comparable to their existing position in good faith, the Employee may within the
       first three months in the new position and after consultation with the Employer to explore other options,
       elect to resign from it, by giving the appropriate notice. The Employee will receive a severance payment
       calculated on the salary and service of the Employee immediately prior to the time s/he was initially
       redeployed.
 (j)   Employees who receive redundancy compensation and are re-employed by the University in a
       permanent or fixed term capacity within twelve (12) months of termination of employment, may be
       required to pay back any redundancy compensation they received. In the case of a permanent
       employment, an employee may be required to pay all or some of their compensation abating on a pro
       rata basis subject to the length of time that has elapsed since their final day of employment with the
       University. In the case of a fixed term appointment, employees will be required pay back some or all
       their redundancy compensation subject to the length of the offer of fixed term employment in
       accordance with (k) below.
 (k)   In the case of redeployment into a fixed term position which by mutual agreement is comparable to
       their existing position and which then ceases to exist, and the Employee is not further redeployed, the
       employee’s employment agreement shall terminate and the Employee will be paid severance on the
       following basis:
       (i)    Where the position ceases during the first 12 months of redeployment the full severance payment
       will be made at the end of the fixed term;
       (ii)   Where the position ceases after a period in excess of one year but not exceeding two years of
              redeployment, 50% of the severance payment will be made at the end of the fixed term;
       (iii) Where the position ceases beyond two years of redeployment no severance payment will be
       made.
       Redundancy:
 (l)   Upon leaving the University because of redundancy the Employee shall be offered a severancepayment
       as follows based on continuous service with the University.
       (a)    Six weeks ordinary pay for the first year (or less) of service to the University.
       (b)    Two weeks ordinary pay for the second and subsequent years or part thereof. The maximum
       severance payment under this clause shall be 40 weeks ordinary pay.
       Annual leave and Long Service Leave due shall be paid in addition to the above payment.
 (m)   Severance payment for a fixed term position that ceases to exist will be calculated on the basis of
       salary and service of the Employee, and will not be greater than the salary that would be due over the
       unexpired portion of the term.
 (n)   Where the employment of an employee engaged in an activity of the University comes to an end
       because that activity is sold or transferred and the person who acquires that activity offers to employ
       that employee:
       (a)    on conditions that are the same as or no less favourable than the existing conditions; and
       (b)    on the basis that service with the University is treated as if it were service with the new employer
              and as if it were continuous;
       and the Employee accepts the offer then the Employee shall not be entitled to any severance payment
       under clause (k) of this agreement.
       Where the Employee declines to accept the position, the Employee will consult with the Employer over
       redeployment and other options contained in clauses (e) to (k), including the following option.
       Where the person acquiring the activity offers a different role or employment on less favourable terms
       and conditions, the Employee(s) may, at their sole option, negotiate with the University over the terms
       and conditions surrounding termination of employment with the University and acceptance of
       employment with the new employer.

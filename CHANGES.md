This document summarises the key changes to the Professional Staff Individual Employment
Agreement (Bands H–L) across the four versions held in this repository.

---

## August 2021 → July 2022

**Minor update — public holiday and formatting**

- **Matariki added as a public holiday** (Section F1). Matariki is listed alongside the existing
  statutory holidays, reflecting the _Te Kāhui o Matariki Public Holiday Act 2022_.
- Minor reformatting of numbered sub-clauses throughout the document (indentation/line-wrap
  changes only; no substantive wording changes).

## July 2022 → December 2022

**Major revision — restructure, new clauses and terminology changes**

### Section A — Parties
- **A1.1**: University's legal name updated to **"Waipapa Taumata Rau | The University of
  Auckland"**.
- **A1.2 (new)**: Added an explicit acknowledgement that the IEA terms and conditions (including
  pay rates) differ from the applicable collective agreement, and that an employee who elects to
  move to the collective agreement will be subject to its pay rates and service-related
  entitlements.

### Section B — Mutual Responsibilities & Superannuation
- **B1.1**: The detailed list of specific good-employer obligations (safe conditions, equal
  employment opportunities, etc.) was removed from the body of the clause, leaving a simplified
  statement that the Employer shall act as a good employer.

### Section D — Remuneration (restructured)
- The Remuneration section was significantly reorganised:
  - **D1 (Evaluation of Positions)** and **D2 (Appeals Against the Job Evaluation Band Outcome)**
    retained from the previous structure.
  - **D3 (Job Evaluation Band Remuneration Ranges)** introduced as a new explicit sub-section,
    referencing the intranet for current ranges rather than listing salary figures in the document.
    D3.1.2 specifies that ranges for 2024 will increase by a minimum of 3%.
  - **D4 (Annual Salary Reviews)** expanded with detailed sub-clauses (D4.1–D4.4) covering the
    annual performance and development cycle, salary increase mechanics ("general revision" paid
    in February), the Tupu performance framework, and an appeal committee process.
  - **D5 (Te Reo Māori Duties)** — section renamed from "Te Reo Duties" to "Te Reo Māori Duties".

### Section F — Holidays and Leave
- **F12 (Family Violence Leave)** added as a new section, providing entitlements in line with the
  _Domestic Violence — Victims' Protection Act 2018_.

### Section G — General Provisions
- **G4**: Section renamed from "Debt Recovery" to "Deductions".
- **G9**: Section renamed from "Confidentiality" to "Confidentiality and Privacy".
- **G11 (Abandonment of Employment)** and **G12 (Termination of Employment)** made explicit
  standalone sections.

## December 2022 → December 2024

**Moderate update — salary review clarifications, gender-neutral language, privacy and
grievance changes**

### Section C — Hours of Work
- **C1.2**: Clarified as "37.5 hours **per week**" (previously just "37.5 hours"). Work-hour
  ranges reformatted to include minutes (e.g., "7:00am–9:00pm" instead of "7 am–9 pm").

### Section D — Remuneration
- **D4.3.1 (Salary Increases)**: Added three explicit exclusions from the annual general revision:
  1. Staff who joined the University after 1 November in the previous calendar year.
  2. Staff promoted or moved to a higher-paying role after 1 November.
  3. Staff who received a pay increase between 1 November and 1 February.
- **D5.1**: "Te Reo" updated to "**Te Reo Māori**" for consistency.

### Section E — Allowances
- **E2.1 (Travel on University Business)**: Reimbursement of expenses now explicitly required to
  be "**in line with University policy**".
- **E3 (Field Work)**: Gender-neutral language adopted — "his/her place of residence" changed to
  "**their** place of residence".

### Section G — General Provisions
- **G6 (Employment Relationship Problems)**: The personal grievance timeframe for **sexual
  harassment** extended to **12 months** from the date the grievance occurs or comes to the
  employee's notice (previously the same 90-day period applied to all grievances, consistent with
  the _Employment Relations Act 2000_ amendment in s108).
- **G9 (Confidentiality and Privacy)**: New clause added stating that employee personal
  information will be treated in accordance with the University's privacy policies, the _Privacy Act
  2020_, and the Information Privacy Principles, and that both parties must comply as policies are
  amended.
- **G10 (Indemnification)**: Gender-neutral language adopted — "his/her employment" changed to
  "**their** employment".

### Appendix A — Redundancy Provisions
- Added note: "**Nothing in this Appendix applies to casual employees.**"
- "Employment Protection Provisions" renamed to "**Employee Protection Provisions**".
- Redundancy notice wording updated: the specific "two months' notice" minimum was replaced with
  a reference to the notice period "as specified in this agreement", allowing for flexibility.
- Minor wording tightening throughout (e.g., "retraining and/or alternatively early retirement"
  instead of "retraining and or alternatively").

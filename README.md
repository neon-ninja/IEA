# Summary of Changes — Professional Staff H–L IEA

This document summarises the key changes to the Professional Staff Individual Employment
Agreement (Bands H–L) across the four versions held in this repository.

---

## August 2021 → July 2022

**Minor update — public holiday and formatting**

- **Matariki added as a public holiday** (Section F1). Matariki is listed alongside the existing
  statutory holidays, reflecting the _Te Kāhui o Matariki Public Holiday Act 2022_.
- Minor reformatting of numbered sub-clauses throughout the document (indentation/line-wrap
  changes only; no substantive wording changes).

## July 2022 → December 2022

**Major revision — restructure, new clauses and terminology changes**

> **Note:** The University published an official [Summary of changes to Professional Staff IEAs](https://bpb-ap-se2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.auckland.ac.nz/dist/8/416/files/2022/12/Summary-of-changes-to-Professional-Staff-IEAs-.pdf)
> for the December 2022 IEA. The items marked 📄 below are drawn from or confirmed by that
> official summary. Items without that mark were identified by directly comparing the IEA documents.

### Section A — Parties
- **A1.1**: University's legal name updated to **"Waipapa Taumata Rau | The University of
  Auckland"**.
- **A1.2 (new)**: Added an explicit acknowledgement that the IEA terms and conditions (including
  pay rates) differ from the applicable collective agreement, and that an employee who elects to
  move to the collective agreement will be subject to its pay rates and service-related
  entitlements.

### Section B — Mutual Responsibilities & Superannuation
- **B1.1 ⚠️ Social justice concern**: The detailed list of specific good-employer obligations was
  **entirely removed** and replaced with a single vague sentence: *"the Employer shall act as a
  good employer."* The previous version explicitly required the employer to provide:
  - Good and safe working conditions
  - An equal employment opportunities programme
  - Impartial selection of suitably qualified persons for appointment
  - Opportunities for the enhancement of the abilities of individual employees
  - **Recognition of the aims, aspirations, and employment requirements of ethnic and minority groups**
  - **Recognition of the employment requirements of women**
  - **Recognition of the employment requirements of persons with disabilities**

  By collapsing these specific commitments into a single generic phrase, the December 2022 version
  **removes the explicit, enforceable protections for women and people with disabilities** that had
  been named in every prior version of this agreement. There is no longer any specific obligation
  on the employer to recognise or accommodate the distinct employment needs of these groups.
  This is a significant regression from a social justice perspective: named protections carry
  legal and moral weight that a vague "good employer" standard does not replicate.

### Section C — Hours of Work
- **C1 (rest period clause)**: The sentence *"All employees are to receive free tea, coffee, milk
  and sugar for breaks."* was **removed**. The December 2022 version retains the entitlement to a
  10-minute rest period in each four-hour period, but the explicit employer obligation to provide
  free tea, coffee, milk and sugar during those breaks no longer appears in the agreement.

### Section D — Remuneration (restructured)
- The Remuneration section was significantly reorganised:
  - **D1 (Evaluation of Positions)** and **D2 (Appeals Against the Job Evaluation Band Outcome)**
    retained from the previous structure.
  - **D3 (Job Evaluation Band Remuneration Ranges)** introduced as a new explicit sub-section,
    referencing the intranet for current ranges rather than listing salary figures in the document.
    D3.1.2 specifies that ranges for 2024 will increase by a minimum of 3%.
  - **D4 (Annual Salary Reviews)** expanded with detailed sub-clauses (D4.1–D4.4) covering the
    annual performance and development cycle, salary increase mechanics ("general revision" paid
    in February), the Tupu performance framework, and an appeal committee process.
  - **D5 (Te Reo Māori Duties)** — section renamed from "Te Reo Duties" to "Te Reo Māori Duties".

### Section F — Holidays and Leave
- **F1 (Public Holidays — Matariki)** 📄: The official summary also lists Matariki as a change in
  the December 2022 IEA. Matariki was first introduced in the July 2022 interim IEA (as
  documented above), and was confirmed and retained in December 2022. The official summary
  appears to compare December 2022 against an earlier base (likely August 2021), hence its
  inclusion here.
- **F4 (Sick Leave)** 📄: The official summary notes the sick leave clause was "updated to reflect
  10 days minimum". Across all four IEA versions (2021, July 2022, December 2022) the clause
  already reads "10 days Sick Leave on pay for each 12 months of service" — the statutory minimum
  increased from 5 to 10 days under the _Holidays (Increasing Sick Leave) Amendment Act 2021_ and
  was already reflected from the August 2021 version onward. The December 2022 update confirmed
  and retained this entitlement.
- **F16 (Family Violence Leave)** 📄 added as a new section (numbered F16 in the December 2022
  IEA; renumbered F12 in December 2024), providing entitlements in line with the
  _Domestic Violence — Victims' Protection Act 2018_. The clause affirms the University's
  commitment to supporting staff experiencing family violence, details available support, and
  includes links to the Family and Relationship Violence and Abuse Policy and the Campus Personal
  Safety Planning Guide.
- **F5 (Parental Leave, renumbered from F7)** 📄: Significantly updated. The new clause:
  - Affirms the importance of **whānau** and links to the revised Parental Leave Policy and
    Procedures (then open for consultation).
  - **Removes the requirement** that an employee "genuinely intends to return to duty" in order to
    access University Paid Parental Leave.
  - **Removes the repayment obligation**: the prior version required employees who did not return
    after parental leave to refund salary paid during that leave.
  - Additional proposed benefits in the new policy include two weeks' paid leave for partners also
    employed at the University, and the ability to take annual leave on full pay after returning to
    work.
- **F7 (Retirement Leave)** 📄: New eligibility restriction added — *"ELIGIBILITY FOR THE BENEFITS
  IN THIS CLAUSE IS LIMITED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WERE EMPLOYED BY THE UNIVERSITY PRIOR TO
  31 JANUARY 2023."* The University confirmed that the entitlements of current staff are not
  affected and remain exactly the same.
- **F8 (Long Service Leave)** 📄: Same eligibility restriction added as Retirement Leave — only
  employees employed by the University prior to 31 January 2023 are eligible for this benefit.

### Section G — General Provisions
- **G4**: Section renamed from "Debt Recovery" to "Deductions".
- **G7.5.2 (Serious Misconduct definition)** 📄: Extended to explicitly include **"deliberate or
  repeated breaches of University policies"** as an example of serious misconduct. The July 2022
  definition ended at "behaviour which leads to significant loss of trust and confidence"; the
  December 2022 version adds this additional ground.
- **G9**: Section renamed from "Confidentiality" to "Confidentiality and Privacy".
- **G11 (Abandonment of Employment)** and **G12 (Termination of Employment)** made explicit
  standalone sections.
- **G12.4 (Notice in Lieu)** 📄 (new sub-clause): *"The Employer shall make a payment in lieu of
  notice to the Employee, where the Employer determines it is not practicable for the Employee to
  work out their notice period."* This provides an explicit mechanism for the employer to pay out
  a departing employee's notice period rather than requiring them to work it out.

---

## December 2022 → December 2024

**Moderate update — salary review clarifications, gender-neutral language, privacy and
grievance changes**

### Section C — Hours of Work
- **C1.2**: Clarified as "37.5 hours **per week**" (previously just "37.5 hours"). Work-hour
  ranges reformatted to include minutes (e.g., "7:00am–9:00pm" instead of "7 am–9 pm").

### Section D — Remuneration
- **D4.3.1 (Salary Increases)**: Added three explicit exclusions from the annual general revision:
  1. Staff who joined the University after 1 November in the previous calendar year.
  2. Staff promoted or moved to a higher-paying role after 1 November.
  3. Staff who received a pay increase between 1 November and 1 February.
- **D5.1**: "Te Reo" updated to "**Te Reo Māori**" for consistency.

### Section E — Allowances
- **E2.1 (Travel on University Business)**: Reimbursement of expenses now explicitly required to
  be "**in line with University policy**".
- **E3 (Field Work)**: Gender-neutral language adopted — "his/her place of residence" changed to
  "**their** place of residence".

### Section G — General Provisions
- **G6 (Employment Relationship Problems)**: The personal grievance timeframe for **sexual
  harassment** extended to **12 months** from the date the grievance occurs or comes to the
  employee's notice (previously the same 90-day period applied to all grievances, consistent with
  the _Employment Relations Act 2000_ amendment in s108).
- **G9 (Confidentiality and Privacy)**: New clause added stating that employee personal
  information will be treated in accordance with the University's privacy policies, the _Privacy Act
  2020_, and the Information Privacy Principles, and that both parties must comply as policies are
  amended.
- **G10 (Indemnification)**: Gender-neutral language adopted — "his/her employment" changed to
  "**their** employment".

### Appendix A — Redundancy Provisions
- Added note: "**Nothing in this Appendix applies to casual employees.**"
- "Employment Protection Provisions" renamed to "**Employee Protection Provisions**".
- Redundancy notice wording updated: the specific "two months' notice" minimum was replaced with
  a reference to the notice period "as specified in this agreement", allowing for flexibility.
- Minor wording tightening throughout (e.g., "retraining and/or alternatively early retirement"
  instead of "retraining and or alternatively").
